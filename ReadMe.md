# ASL Gesture Recognition System

ASL Gesture Recognition System is a Python-based application that utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize American Sign Language (ASL) gestures from video input. The application detects hand gestures in real-time using computer vision techniques and predicts the corresponding ASL letters using a pre-trained deep learning model.
